# FinerPlan - Financial Early Retirement Planner #

This program intends to help those people seeking financial independence and 
early retirement to track and analyze their finances. It's designed so that 
you can focus on how to improve your savings rate and predict when you can set FIRE!

## Disclaimer
This is my first big project and the program is still in a really early 
development stage. It's not well suited for any kind of serious work. My main 
goals are to solve a personal need while I develop skills in programming, 
project management and other areas.

## Getting Started

Create a local copy of the repository in the current folder
> git clone https://github.com/fcqueiroz/finerplan.git

Run flask on port 5001
> flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001  

The application will greet you on _http://localhost:5001/_
