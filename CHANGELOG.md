# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
 - Overview shows how much is owed in the next credit card invoice, current month earnings and investments made
 - 'last expenses' view shows the payment method
 - 'add transaction' form accepts investments and earnings
 - Three payment methods are available; 'Dinheiro' for cash transactions, 'Cr√©dito' for transactions with a credit card and 'Terceiros' (explained below).
 - When using the credit payment method, the number of installments can be included.
 - Expenses paid in credit (and their installments) automatically get the cash date assigned to the payment dates according to the period when the expense ocurred and the date when the invoice closes. 
 - The 'Terceiros' pay method is a way of keeping track of expenses that don't change the cash flow because another person paid for it. When used, an entry of equal value is created on the earnings table
 - Overview now shows debt free balance, last 12 months average expending and  exponential moving average (calculated for all periods) expending.

### Changed
 - 'Last expenses' view presents entries by the accrual date in reverse order (most recent on top) and doesn't show the id numbers column anymore
 - special dates constants are update everytime they are needed

### Fixed
 - By default, the analysis take into account the accrual data. The currently existing exceptions are the balance value and the credit card invoice value, which consider the cash data.
 - Overview gathers information from database AFTER new expenses are added, so the user can immediatly see the new entry on 'last expenses' view
 - App couldn't open in certain dates close to the month ending
